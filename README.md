PROJECT TITLE
Self-Driving Food Delivery Drone

==================================================

HACKATHON SUBMISSION

This project presents a self-driving food delivery drone designed for controlled campuses and residential communities.
The system focuses on autonomous navigation, safety, and efficient last-mile food delivery.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

Food delivery within campuses and gated communities often faces delays due to traffic, manpower limitations, and logistical inefficiencies.
There is a need for a faster, contactless, and automated delivery system that can operate safely in controlled environments.

SOLUTION OVERVIEW

The proposed solution is a self-driving food delivery drone that autonomously transports food from a pickup location to the delivery point.
It uses GPS and onboard sensors to navigate predefined routes, avoid obstacles, and ensure accurate and secure delivery.


KEY FEATURES

Autonomous navigation using GPS

Obstacle detection and avoidance using onboard sensors

Safe operation in controlled environments

Efficient and contactless food delivery

Reduced delivery time and human effort


TECHNOLOGIES USED
